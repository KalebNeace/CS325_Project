-Phone works well. Battery showing 93% health with testing app. My S20 Ultra has a few scratches on the corners, some paint worn off around camera pop out, and a small nick on the front screen but I can live with that. Looks good with a screen protector and case. Is that excellent condition? I don't know... I'm happy overall that I got a phone that works properly and holds a charge.

-Like any item referred it never is fully repaired. Phone works good, it has a a quirky moment when uou lay it down it will turn off. Other then that it's good.

-Great deal. It came with a screen protector and a case which we changed out for an otterbox. It looks brand new. There wasn't a Sim card but it is set up for esim so no problem. Packed well. Very satisfied.

I wrote to verify battery health before buying and they were quick to respond and sent what they said. Warranty information came before the phone and excellent follow up from the seller. After a couple not-so-excellent transactions trying to get this model, I was amazed at their great customer service. Phone was well packaged, included the noted accessories. I would highly recommend!

Thank you very much for the excellent service. Hope to do business with you again.

-Such a great purchase !! Phone came in a nice box and is working great!! I really needed a new one and the price was good for what you are getting. I didn’t see any problems on mine at all no scratches no nothing! Great purchase and great seller they even messaged me to make sure if anything is wrong to let them know so they would fix it!!

-Phone was described as "excellent", 100% accurate, not a single scratch or dent. Seller was super responsive and helpful! Including a 1 year warranty, which is more than I received when buying a brand new phone from best buy lol. Seller shipped immediately and was very friendly, included screen protector and accessories, overall amazing experience and will definitely recommend this Seller!!

-First of all, great seller! i have made a purchase with them twice and even recommended to a friend who is also satisfied with the purchase and services. I made typo mistake on delivery order, and contacted them immediately, and they fixed the delivery right after and has been nothing but helpful and effective. The item is in great condition and as described. Thank you!

-Great price and very fast shipping. Item was exactly as advertised and packaged well. Highly recommend seller.

-Everything was as described. Great seller. I can't blame the seller for the shipping delay, that's on USPS. USPS is, in my opinion, the slowest company for shipping but they are the cheapest. So you get what you pay for. With that in mind, if you need it on time or sooner, pay the extra money and use Fedex . I will use this seller again and highly recommend but I will try to ship with Fedex for future purchases.

-The phone arrived well packaged and as advertised in excellent condition. Shipping was very fast. When I or someone I know is in need of a phone this seller would definitely be the first stop on the list. They are a class act! The included 1yr warranty sealed the deal! I added them to my favorite sellers list.

-Quick shipping. Phone arrived in exactly as described in an excellent condition. Battery is like new. Great communication from seller! If I buy a refurbished phone again I will definitely buy from this seller. Happy buyer :) 10 stars ⭐️

-When you see “good” condition on a listing you’re expecting the item to be less than flawless, this phone is in almost new condition! And for such a great price. The seller was very responsive to any questions I had and I will definitely look at the seller when making future eBay phone purchases ! Fast shipping, great quality, 100% good experience.

-It arrived quickly, was exactly as presented. It is everything I wanted it to be. The seller provided clear concise conjunction, so I was never left with unanswered questions. I had done extensive research on the type of phone I wanted & I got exactly that. I would recommend ebay refurbished phones as well as this seller to anyone

-Very satisfied with order! Was a gift for my son's 16th bday. He absolutely love it. Fast shipping, items as described, packaged well. A++++ Seller and highly recommended.

-Phone was exactly as described,was delivered on time but due to a mess up with the usps it was delayed a few days. The communication with seller was very good and I would not hesitate to use them again.

-Glad I chose these guys. Buying a 5 year old phone was such a risk but the easy returns they offer were reassuring. The device arrived in mint condition as expected and came with a protective screen that's kinda smaller than the screen itself but whatever, good enough. Overall, fast shipping with honest description and good communication is what any buyer wants and this seller delivered.
