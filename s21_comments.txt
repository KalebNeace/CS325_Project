-Phone is just what I wanted. Just as described, great condition, everything functional, and working well. Shipping was right on time, easy setup and accessories included. Great Seller !!!

-Galaxy S21 ordered, received in "like new" condition. Functions well, PERFECT condition at a great price! RECOMMENDED seller and product.

-Great seller. Fast shipping. Item appears to be in like new condition. Looks great. Unable to determine electronic functionality until i get it activated.

-Works great but I'll probably have to change the battery in 6 months as it discharges 47% (on battery saver, max 80%, so at 33% ) in 3 days with little to no activity as a back-up, stand-by phone almost never used. I could've exchanged but the phone is very good otherwise and charges quickly. Also, the charger with a cable is a nice touch by the vendor. Will return.

-So stoked! I have been using a broken cheap version for so long and the differences are so extreme. I figured I had bad signal at around my place and work. Nope! I have signal everywhere! And the speed of the phone and screen color... I want to compare it to when they finally sliced bread before sale lol life changijg. There's a tiny bit of wear on the bottom. Hard to see. Still nervous so I'll update if needed but the seller is responsive and true to his word. Phone is as described + better.

-Got this phone to replace my mom's s8+ since the battery was going. I knew there would be some cosmetic damage but the entire screen was covered in light scratches. a bit disappointing but I knew it was luck of the draw with this kind of thing. One screen protector later and it was like-new. My mom was very pleased with her upgrade!

-Perfect... phone was in "better then described Condition".. Not a scratch on the screen, looks almost new... Worked as soon as I put the chip in... Phone was packaged well, also came with a new charger and cord.... would definitely purchase from again.... Unlocked Spectrum Mobile Carrier

-Excelente calidad, imagen y funcionamiento perfecto, es reconstruido pero hasta el momento ningún problema. Envío super rápido muy contenta con esta compra. Recomiendo totalmente.

-Have had the phone for almost 2 weeks now and it excellent. Seller was easy to work with. The phone was in the condition described which was used in 9.5/10 condition and factory unlocked. I'd more like 10/10 condition and works great with Mint Mobile. The price was very reasonable, so reasonable that I bought 2 of these phones from the seller. Phones arrived in great condition, no issues with shipping. Would definitely purchase from seller again.

-Didn't end up keeping it because it didn't have a headphone jack, but that was no fault of the seller. Phone was in great shape.

-Phone arrived in a timely manner and was in excellent shape! Unfortunately, it didn't work quite right with the Network carrier I had. Frank went out of his way to help get it returned, refunded, and the correct phone headed my way. He was patient, understanding, and quick to respond. I can't say enough about the service I received. I would DEFINITELY buy from them again! Excellent product and even better service!

-Great phone in great condition. Very good for money. THank you Mr. Seller. I was worried about shipping. I called the seller and it was fixed the next morning. GREAT SERVICE

-So far it seems to be a good working phone. I expected it to be a bit bigger but other than that overall I like it so far.

-Phone is in excellent condition as advertised and the seller's communication was stellar! Impressive. I wrote to verify battery health before buying and they were quick to respond and sent what they said. Warranty information came before the phone and excellent follow up from the seller. After a couple not-so-excellent transactions trying to get this model, I was amazed at their great customer service. Phone was well packaged, included the noted accessories. I would highly recommend!

Thank you very much for the excellent service. Hope to do business with you again.

-Such a great purchase !! Phone came in a nice box and is working great!! I really needed a new one and the price was good for what you are getting. I didn’t see any problems on mine at all no scratches no nothing! Great purchase and great seller they even messaged me to make sure if anything is wrong to let them know so they would fix it!!

-Phone was described as "excellent", 100% accurate, not a single scratch or dent. Seller was super responsive and helpful! Including a 1 year warranty, which is more than I received when buying a brand new phone from best buy lol. Seller shipped immediately and was very friendly, included screen protector and accessories, overall amazing experience and will definitely recommend this Seller!!

-First of all, great seller! i have made a purchase with them twice and even recommended to a friend who is also satisfied with the purchase and services. I made typo mistake on delivery order, and contacted them immediately, and they fixed the delivery right after and has been nothing but helpful and effective. The item is in great condition and as described. Thank you!

-Great price and very fast shipping. Item was exactly as advertised and packaged well. Highly recommend seller.

-Everything was as described. Great seller. I can't blame the seller for the shipping delay, that's on USPS. USPS is, in my opinion, the slowest company for shipping but they are the cheapest. So you get what you pay for. With that in mind, if you need it on time or sooner, pay the extra money and use Fedex . I will use this seller again and highly recommend but I will try to ship with Fedex for future purchases.

-The phone arrived well packaged and as advertised in excellent condition. Shipping was very fast. When I or someone I know is in need of a phone this seller would definitely be the first stop on the list. They are a class act! The included 1yr warranty sealed the deal! I added them to my favorite sellers list.

-Quick shipping. Phone arrived in exactly as described in an excellent condition. Battery is like new. Great communication from seller! If I buy a refurbished phone again I will definitely buy from this seller. Happy buyer :) 10 stars ⭐️

-When you see “good” condition on a listing you’re expecting the item to be less than flawless, this phone is in almost new condition! And for such a great price. The seller was very responsive to any questions I had and I will definitely look at the seller when making future eBay phone purchases ! Fast shipping, great quality, 100% good experience.

-It arrived quickly, was exactly as presented. It is everything I wanted it to be. The seller provided clear concise conjunction, so I was never left with unanswered questions. I had done extensive research on the type of phone I wanted & I got exactly that. I would recommend ebay refurbished phones as well as this seller to anyone

-Very satisfied with order! Was a gift for my son's 16th bday. He absolutely love it. Fast shipping, items as described, packaged well. A++++ Seller and highly recommended.

-Phone was exactly as described,was delivered on time but due to a mess up with the usps it was delayed a few days. The communication with seller was very good and I would not hesitate to use them again.

-Glad I chose these guys. Buying a 5 year old phone was such a risk but the easy returns they offer were reassuring. The device arrived in mint condition as expected and came with a protective screen that's kinda smaller than the screen itself but whatever, good enough. Overall, fast shipping with honest description and good communication is what any buyer wants and this seller delivered.

-Top notch Seller! Great communication and easy to work with. I purchased a phone for my elderly sisters birthday but she never came by to pick it up. I just returned it unopened in original packaging. If I ever buy a second phone for my business this is the online seller I will contact . A+++++
