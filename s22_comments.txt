-Unlocked Glxy S22 ultra, this seller is A+. The condition of the phone was refurbished/excellent & that's a perfect description of the phone they sent me. There isn't a scratch on the device and, as an unlocked phone, it's fully functional with mobile data & hotspot capabilities on straight talk prepaid cards, and the S pen is amazing. I'm not convinced it isn't straight from the manufacturer. They answered all my Q's before my purchase as well. Shipping took a few extra days but was worth it.

-The phones were in excellent condition and Unlocked as advertised. Shipping was fast. I just switched the Sims from our S8's and we were good to go. We did have to run through a bunch of updates, but not a big deal.

-Prestine condition, I love it, every works perfectly, great cosmetic, I thought that it was a new phone, truly happy with your services, do keep up the great work

-Let's start with quick shipping. The phones are in excellent cosmetic condition, unlocked and we were able to switch Sim cards and set up with relative ease. Just what we wanted.

-Phone was described as "excellent", 100% accurate, not a single scratch or dent. Seller was super responsive and helpful!

Seller shipped immediately and was very friendly, included screen protector and accessories, overall amazing experience and will definitely recommend this Seller!!

-First of all, great seller! i have made a purchase with them twice and even recommended to a friend who is also satisfied with the purchase and services. I made typo mistake on delivery order, and contacted them immediately, and they fixed the delivery right after and has been nothing but helpful and effective. The item is in great condition and as described. Thank you!

-Great price and very fast shipping. Item was exactly as advertised and packaged well. Highly recommend seller.

-Everything was as described. Great seller. I can't blame the seller for the shipping delay, that's on USPS. USPS is, in my opinion, the slowest company for shipping but they are the cheapest. So you get what you pay for. With that in mind, if you need it on time or sooner, pay the extra money and use Fedex . I will use this seller again and highly recommend but I will try to ship with Fedex for future purchases.

-The phone arrived well packaged and as advertised in excellent condition. Shipping was very fast. When I or someone I know is in need of a phone this seller would definitely be the first stop on the list. They are a class act! The included 1yr warranty sealed the deal! I added them to my favorite sellers list.

The seller was very responsive to any questions I had and I will definitely look at the seller when making future eBay phone purchases ! Fast shipping, great quality, 100% good experience.

-It arrived quickly, was exactly as presented. It is everything I wanted it to be. The seller provided clear concise conjunction, so I was never left with unanswered questions. I had done extensive research on the type of phone I wanted & I got exactly that. I would recommend ebay refurbished phones as well as this seller to anyone

-Phone was exactly as described,was delivered on time but due to a mess up with the usps it was delayed a few days. The communication with seller was very good and I would not hesitate to use them again.

-Glad I chose these guys. Buying a 5 year old phone was such a risk but the easy returns they offer were reassuring. The device arrived in mint condition as expected and came with a protective screen that's kinda smaller than the screen itself but whatever, good enough. Overall, fast shipping with honest description and good communication is what any buyer wants and this seller delivered.
