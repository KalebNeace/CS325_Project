-Shipping was super fast, phone looks brand new. Talk back feature does not work, almost thought it had completely shut phone down for a minute, but the phone is for my elderly dad and he basically just needs the call feature to work and receiving and making calls has worked just fine so far. Haven't tried much else since the talk back feature kind of put us in panic mode and my dad isn't really tech-savvy anyway- so, it's serving it's purpose for him.

-The phone is in excellent condition. I love every bit of it. I just wish that the generic charger that came with it is not regular charger. All the phone now a days are FAST CHARGING PHONE. Sending a regular charger with this phone does not make sense.

-This item is in like new condition and includes just about everything a brand new phone would have: Box, manuals, SIM card tool, USB cable and adapter (though, as specified in the description, not OEM). I wasn't expecting all of this when I purchased the phone. It's almost like buying it brand new. Even includes a one year warranty. Don't know much about the warranty but I didn't buy it because it came with a warranty. That's just a nice touch. Very satisfied.

-Fast shipping, Item looks brand new even though it was advertised as reconditioned. My only disappointment was that the charger is very slow. Luckily I have an original Samsung charger to use instead.

-Well working good but it has a burnt pixel top right of screen. Pretty big. But the wife said it doesn't bother her.

-Shipped super fast and was packaged wonderfully! The condition is amazing!!! Iâ€™m totally floored by how beautiful the device looks, and it works like a dream. Beyond pleased with this purchase! Thank you!!!

-Great looking device, good working condition. Sometimes I noticed that the battery charge goes down than what I was expecting, but maybe is because is a refurbished used cellphone. Prompt shipment. Mostly satisfied with my purchase.

-Quick shipping, loved the inclusion of charger and sim removal tool. Used the phone for a month now and the phone was EXCELLENT quality, no defects. VERY happy with this purchase.

-I have yet to test the "Refurbished Phone" so I cannot rate it. However, the seller kept me in the loop when the shipment got delayed and was not delivered whiting the time frame the seller stated. The update was timely, I do appreciate that about the seller. The phone looks great and clean, I do hope it works just as well.

-Phone came as described, apart from a small scratch on the bottom left of the screen (expected since description said it could have them) the phone was in pretty good condition. Totally worth it for the price. Shipping was quick and the phone was also packaged securely. A charger (not original) was included inside the box and a SIM ejection tool was also included, the latter I don't see many sellers include so thank you very much for that! Would definitely buy again from this seller!

-It came sooner that I was expecting, when I got the package and opened it up I was very pleased on the detail of the shipping package it was in.

I've already reached out to this seller to thank them for getting my order shipped within minutes of me paying for it and they responded right away. Highly recommend this shop, you won't regret any purchases made through them. Top notch.

-Excellent seller, fast shipping, and watch just as described. Very minor scuffs on exterior, but don't affect function. Came with working charger and new-looking band. Only thing was at first, battery was draining in less than 24 hours. I contacted seller to ask about changing the battery and if that might fix the fast drain. Seller responded right away, very kindly said I could exchange the watch or get a refund. I discovered battery saver mode and am now happy with it! A+++++

-Came as expected. No damage to the frame however there is a micro scratch on the screen but it isn't a big deal. Battery was at 99% health and easily lasts all day still. Shipping was fast and came packed nice and protective. I would absolutely recommend them to anyone because they were fast, easy, fair priced, came as described, and nothing was wrong with the phone.

-The condition of the phone was as described, Excellent! There's one small scratch on the frame right next to the glass. An artifact of the referb is my guess. Cellfeee is a blazingly fast shipper. When they saw I was looking at phone they sweetened the pot with free upgrade to two day shipping and finally 10% off. No doubt Cellfeee made money. I hope so. I intend to buy my next phone from them. Communication was superb. All in all I couldn't seriously expect more. A+
